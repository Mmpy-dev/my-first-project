# My First Project

This is a Python practice project aimed at learning Git and GitHub, managing real projects with virtual environments, and making professional commits.

--- 

## Technologies
- Python 3.14 - main language used for scripts and program logic
- Virtual environment (venv) - to manage packages and create an isolated environment
- Requests - for working with APIs (installation: pip install requests)
- Pretty Print - to display outputs nicely and clearly

--- 

## Execution
1. Check Python version:
python --version
2. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mmpy-dev/my-first-project.git
3. Go to the project folder:
cd my-first-project
4. Activate the virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate # macOS / Linux
5. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the Python file:
python main.py

## Professional Notes
- Apply experimental changes on a separate branch: git checkout -b feature-branch
- Keeping commits organized and descriptive helps maintain a clean project history

## About Me
I am Mmpy, interested in Python and AI. This project is my first step towards building real-world projects on GitHub, practicing secure commits, branch management, and professional pushes.
